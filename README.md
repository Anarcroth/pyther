# PYTHER (Python Typing Test)

You know those tests, where you type some words as fast as you can and then it tells you how fast you typed?
Why not have the same thing in the terminal?

## Installation and launching

### Linux

Right now you can just pull this repository and launch the game from there,
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Anarcroth/pyther.git
cd pyther
python3 pyther.py
```

To see your score
```bash
cat score
```

### Windows TBA

### Mac TBA

##### Dependencies

Pyther uses `curses` and `python3`.

## More words?

Currently this comes with only one list of words, but in the near future more will be added (see *TODO* section).

## Contributions

Everybody is welcomed to contribute and expand this project. Originally started as a way to learn the language, this turned out to be quite the fun little task.

### TODO
* List high scores after each game
* Add command line options
* Add more lists with words
* Make transition from end game to main menu smoother
* Package application
* Add more modes

### Note
I took inspiration from other typing tests. I do not mean to steal or neglect their contribution to the typing community.
